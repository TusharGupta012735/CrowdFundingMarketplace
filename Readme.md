# CrowdFunding Marketplace

CrowdFunding Marketplace is a decentralized platform that enables users to create and support crowdfunding campaigns on the blockchain. Built with Solidity, Node.js, React, and the Base blockchain, the platform allows users to donate to campaigns in a secure and transparent way using smart contracts.

## Project Overview

This project combines blockchain technology with web development to create a transparent, decentralized crowdfunding marketplace. Users can create campaigns, donate funds, and track the progress of different campaigns. The smart contract, deployed on the Base Sepolia testnet, facilitates the creation of campaigns and the processing of donations. The backend (built with Node.js and Express) interacts with the smart contract to fetch campaign data and handle donations, while the frontend (built with React) provides a user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Base Sepolia, Solidity, ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, ethers.js
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity for managing campaigns and donations
- **Authentication**: MetaMask for connecting wallets

## Features

- **Create Campaigns**: Users can create new crowdfunding campaigns with a target goal and deadline.
- **Donate to Campaigns**: Donors can contribute to campaigns using cryptocurrency (ETH).
- **Track Donations**: Users can view the total donations raised by each campaign.
- **Transparent Transactions**: All donations are recorded on the blockchain for full transparency.
